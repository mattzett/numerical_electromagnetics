basic numerical solutions to some electromagnetic problems

## Special functions

A script located at ```./specfun/basic_specfuns.py``` will show how use scipy to compute some common special functions (Legendre polynomials, Bessel functions, spherical Bessel functions, and Spherical Harmonics) and then how to visualize them.
